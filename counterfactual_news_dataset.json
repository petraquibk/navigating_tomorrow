As part of this project, WMI has created videos and written lessons, alongside accompanying resource materials for teachers, to incorporate music into remote learning. Through this partnership, Carnegie Hall serves grades K-12 through musical learning. Now, more than ever, access to opportunity is vital. \"The New York Community Trust, in partnership with NYC's Department of Education, reached out to us to create direct-to-student online learning materials because they saw the gap that was widening in arts education during the pandemic,\" Johnson continued. \" Carnegie Hall is happy to be partnering with our colleagues at leading New York cultural institutions to deliver robust musical programming that addresses a vital need right now for New York's public schoolchildren and teachers.\" said Tim, a teacher from Harwich, Massachusetts.

                                        "description": "NEW YORK (NYT NEWS SERVICE) .- When Robert F. Smith, the billionaire philanthropist, became the new chairman of Carnegie Hall in 2016, he seemed almost too good to be true. He promised to be a stabilizing presence at Carnegie after the brief, tumultuous reign of his predecessor. Smith was a benefactor with deep pockets and a strong interest in the halls education efforts. Smiths admission that he had failed to report a substantial amount of income to the Internal Revenue Service made Carnegie Hall the latest in a line of major cultural institutions that have found themselves facing questions about the actions of the benefactors that they rely on for their very survival. He has done an outstanding job leading Carnegie Hall. A poster near its locked front doors this fall riffed on the ancient joke  How do you get to Carnegie Hall? And  now Im absolutely committed to continuing my important work, my philanthropy.\n\n\n\nCarnegie Halls board members seem to have accepted Smiths mea culpa and moved on. He is beloved, said Darren Walker the president of the Ford Foundation, who is a Carnegie trustee. I do not think we should ask for his resignation. L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, sought a prominent profile in New Yorks art world, joining the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art, before being convicted of grand larceny, conspiracy and fraud. And last year Warren B. Kanders was forced to step down as a vice chairman of the Whitney after protests over his companys sale of tear gas. ( He later got out of the tear gas business.) As part of his agreement with prosecutors, Smith will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, abandon a $182 million tax refund he had been seeking for charitable contributions, and cooperate with ongoing investigations. His departure put an end to talks about a new major Perelman gift; soon after he left, he donated $75 million to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site. After Smith arrived, things seemed to calm down on Carnegies board. Everybody makes mistakes in life; what matters is how you deal with them, he said. And hes a man of great integrity, thats everything that I see.\n\n\n\nThe reluctance of Carnegie Halls board to dethrone Smith is understandable; he is financially generous, gets high marks as a collegial steward, and  named the richest Black man in America by Forbes in 2015  is the first African American to hold the Carnegie Hall post at a time when the lack of diversity at many cultural organizations has become a pressing issue. That money includes $20 million of his personal funds, with the other half coming from Smiths Fund II Foundation, which helped finance the expansion of Carnegie Halls national music education programs. Smith, who loves music (he named his youngest sons, Hendrix and Legend, after Jimi Hendrix and John Legend), has also supported the Halls National Youth Orchestra of the USA; Ensemble Connect, a fellowship program for young professional musicians; and its growing digital activities. The decision made 20 years ago has regrettably led to this turmoil, which has put undue stress and burden on too many.Experts in philanthropy said that they believe the donations he made to Carnegie were not likely at risk of having to be returned.He reached a plea agreement and paid penalties, so I dont think there is any exposure, said Daniel Kurtz, an attorney specializing in nonprofits.",

Smith has made significant donations to the hall, including $20 million of his personal funds, and has supported various programs and initiatives. The incident has highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in philanthropy, particularly at cultural institutions that rely on the generosity of benefactors.",

Bell believed he could be the cornerstone for Pittsburgh as the Pirates looked to retool under general manager Ben Cherington and manager Derek Shelton, both of whom came aboard following the team's disastrous second-half collapse in 2019 that led to a top-to-bottom revamp in the organization. He is under contractual control through at least the 2022 season. \"We're going to need to continue to focus on the accumulation of talent and then the development of that talent, and that comes from all different avenues,'' Cherington said. \" Yean, 19, signed with Washington as a nondrafted free agent in 2020.",

He tackled it head-on and did about as good of a job as anybody can do, so I’m excited to watch Jamo take the mound at PNC.” General manager Ben Cherington has hinted that there are few truly untouchable players on the roster save for perhaps third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes, who finished sixth in the 2020 Rookie of the Year balloting despite not being called up until September. Any shot at going the distance was off the table. Yet the gesture of Keller's teammates going to bat for him stuck with Shelton.",

Three members of the state’s seven-member top court, the Court of Appeals, seemed hostile to the idea of revisiting the thorny mapmaking process, a year after an independent expert in Pennsylvania drew the lines. Last year, the commission imploded, failing to reach consensus in its effort to make a map for the midterms, and eventually giving up. Members of the court who ruled against the Democratic-drawn map last year — in a case called Harkenrider v. Hochul — appeared frustrated that they had to reconsider the issue on Wednesday. And I don’t see a basis to overturn that remedy.” Court watchers have said they can see the Court of Appeals ruling either way. Last year, the Court of Appeals voted 4-to-3 to reject the House map drawn by Democratic lawmakers. But Halligan recused herself, citing a close personal relationship with an attorney or party in the case, according to the court.",

Denita Wawn, CEO Master Builders Australia: Good morning. Matthew: So you met with people here yesterday, what was the outcome? This just will put a hand brake on our capacity to do this. So a lot of shaking heads, a lot of anxiety about the significant changes that will dramatically hit the industry. The government and particularly the unions have been pushing for an awful long time, decades, that they disagree with the notion of casual employment of independent contracting, and that everyone really should be either a full time or part-time permanent employee and that’s what’s good for them.

However, since 2022, the brand has improved the chair's sustainability with parts of Sayl containing ocean-bound plastic – plastic waste from coastal areas that are on a path to the ocean. Béhar's understanding of upcoming trends is evident in seating designs like Sayl chair, with its focus on flexibility and wellbeing, and is also shown in his Public Office Landscape collection, which he developed in 2013 for Herman Miller. The designer's admiration for the Eames initially kickstarted his collaboration with Herman Miller. Find out more about Dezeen partnership content here.",

The buildup was enormous — and then the day before the game Schembechler died unexpectedly at 77. The game lived up to the hype and played out like nothing Woody and Bo would have recognized during their battles. 3 Michigan played the first overtime game in the history of the series and the Wolverines took a three-point lead on their first possession. The Buckeyes had a fourth-and-1 on their possession, and Meyer went for it instead of kicking for a tie. J.T. Barrett just barely made the line to gain and the spot was upheld on review. Harbaugh faced enormous criticism for not being able to beat Ohio State. That ended on a cold day two years ago amid light snow in Ann Arbor.",

X OUT THOSE Ms. Rivalry Week has arrived on Ohio State's campus. When I was a freshman in Siebert Hall, the resident advisor for the sixth floor (best floor) told me and several other students that there are well over 1,000 Ms posted in the square between Lane Avenue, Kenny Road, 10th Avenue and High Street. Since he told me that unverifiable fact – well, it is verifiable, but I'll never walk the entire square footage of Ohio State's campus to check how accurate it is – I have often wondered how many Ms are in Columbus and how much tape it would take to cover them.

Murphy on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2023, launched a bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in next year's contest. ( Her candidacy, announced Wednesday, puts her in the running to become the first woman elected to the Senate from New Jersey. Patricia Campos-Medina, a political activist and labor leader, said she is also considering a run on the Democratic side and that she's heard from people that they're concerned about the possibility of losing a Latino voice in the U. S. Senate if Menendez doesn't return. On the GOP side, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner is seeking the Senate seat next year. She became a Democrat before her husband's run for office. The first lady was named in a gender discrimination lawsuit this year brought by state troopers who worked on the detail responsible for providing security for the governor. Menendez criticized Tammy Murphy in a statement Wednesday for being a “card-carrying Republican for years” and said she'd have to answer for the policies of her husband's administration, echoing similar attacks the GOP tried against the governor in his 2021 reelection bid. Menendez has since won three elections to the Senate.",

The deal, which aims to create a regional economic bloc covering nearly half of the world's population, has been met with skepticism by some Indian politicians and economists who argue that it does not adequately address India's concerns about market access and intellectual property protection.",

Halfway across the globe in New York, the US District Court issued an indictment accusing an Indian government employee of directing a plot against the assassination of a US citizen and a Khalistani terrorist. While the first development risked a breakdown in the India-US ties, the latter was a welcome affirmation of India’s claims along the disputed boundary with China. Both events aptly summed up the India policy of the Biden administration: a policy of contradictions. What should be made of these mixed signals coming out of the United States? India is just another issue on which Americans are unable to agree. Even the Saudis are in the same boat, leading to their strategic diversification in China and Russia. The United States has historically had credibility issues, from South Vietnam to Afghanistan (and Ukraine in the pipeline). But when it comes to India, this has utterly failed because the corresponding forces run contradictory to each other. The interests of the new professional elites are material and not affected by India’s domestic politics. The writing on the wall cannot be clearer. What can New Delhi do in these circumstances? My observations reflect only one reality: though China remains the biggest strategic challenge for India, the United States is the biggest intellectual challenge for our strategic community.

If you listen closely, Brennan is often being self-deprecating. We caught up with Brennan to talk about creating the idea, the many characters that appear in his skits, and what it was like making his first Jerky Boys album in two-plus decades, The Jerky Boys: Balloon Animals, which came out in November. Johnny Brennan: I don’t remember my first, per se. But it was more physical stuff [at first]. And I know you’ve voiced Mort in Family Guy. Jack is so colorful and I get to be lots of things all wrapped up in one, you know? Howard was actually very instrumental in catapulting the whole Jerky Boys. It was at a family reunion up in Wurtsboro, New York. And it was about 1985 and my cousins are all coming up to me and they’re like, “Johnny, man, that stuff that you’re doing for Joey and Anthony and Jason.” Do you ever feel remorse for making someone feel flustered or giving them the wrong impression of reality? I’m not mean-spirited, I’m not a mean-spirited person. More or less, I’d say he’s there to shock them. What does that success and that response from your fans mean to you? And it’s [my character talking] Sol Rosenberg and people just enjoy listening to this poor little fucker, you know, his eyes are going crazy. Radio DJs all over the country biting off The Jerky Boys. Howard Stern said it best, he said, “There never will be another Jerky Boys. Funny enough, Jimmy Kimmel actually called me at my house many years ago and asked me to be part of Crank Yankers. So, The Jerky Boys, it stands on it’s own. I was literally pissing myself in the car. We got to follow up number one, we need another record!” So, I remember just sitting down and I needed to get probably about fifteen or twenty calls. Over all these years, I didn’t have a single track that I could use. It’s funny, the title’s not on the record because I didn’t want to ruin Sean Taggart’s artwork. They’d play the shit out of my records and it would inspire and they’d come up with anecdotes and a lot of good stuff. You know, New York City will always bounce back. What is your relationship with The Jerky Boys co-founder, Kamal Ahmed? What have you learned about yourself from being on the phone so often? But now when I do these live shows, I see what it means to people and it means the world to them.",

Confused, but seemingly satisfied, Albert accepts the story and leaves. It's pure fanboy indulgence on the director's part, but damn, is it absolutely perfect; a wish-fulfillment kind of moment you never knew you wanted to see until you see it — like John Hurt reprising the Alien role of Kane in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs. Enough of the accurate details (like Doc's cumbersome ice maker and flowing mane of white hair) are there to spark delight in the audience. Doc Brown's here,'\" the writer-director says in a behind-the-scenes featurette about the small tribute to Part III. \" He was just an affable, kind, pleasant guy, who really loved being there. The other thing that was nice to hear was, we were told that he loves that character, and that's refreshing to me because oftentimes you see actors who are identified with iconic characters and all they wanna do is distance themselves [from them]. After delivering two hit TV shows (Family Guy, American Dad) and the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy in history (Ted), MacFarlane had some serious clout and influence in Hollywood that allowed him to give in to his wildest impulses on A Million Ways to Die in the West. Sure, I'm also a little sad and bitter that the epic cameo was ruined for me in one of the promotional trailers.",

I mean, those are all the good things--\n\nPresident Donald Trump: The priority now--\n\nLesley Stahl: --what do you have to solve? President Donald Trump: --is to get back to normal.

Lesley Stahl: Well, that's goin' after her--\n\nPresident Donald Trump: I think the way she locked down Michigan is a disgrace.

Some people like to say what begins with the Jews then ends with the Jews. “When you see an act of discrimination and prejudice, call it out for what it is. On some level, antisemitism is a prejudice like other prejudices … but it has certain unique elements.” They don’t advocate for a two-state solution, or even a one-state solution. Lipstadt said Musk’s actions were “irresponsible.” The court ruled that the movie was not deemed obscene. Lipstadt said we can do better than that but conceded that there are times when it calls for the “I know it when I see it” approach. Nothing justifies taking civilians hostage,” she said. As someone who has a great deal of experience addressing Holocaust denial, Lipstadt was asked about those who deny the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Lipstadt said she has found that the most potent arguments against Holocaust denial is Nazi evidence, including German army reports, German government reports and statements by Germans. WJW asked Lipstadt about the videos of Hamas’ barbarism that the Israeli government has aired for journalists, which document some of the horrific acts that took place on Oct. 7.",

In talks at his home in London on Friday, they shared concerns over the rise in hate crime in general and in antisemitism in particular. They discussed in detail the incidence of antisemitism on campus as well as opportunities for Muslim-Jewish dialogue. Ambassador Lipstadt was appointed to the post in March this year. During her UK visit, she also met the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Angela Rayner, tweeting that it was a pleasure sitting down with members of the party �to reaffirm our shared values and commitment to combat antisemitism and other hatreds, wherever they rear their ugly head.� She was also hosted at the House of Lords by the UK�s special envoy on post-Holocaust issues, Lord Pickles. She was �grateful for the partnership between the US and the UK to fight antisemitism, intolerance and hate on both sides of the Atlantic,� she tweeted.

The two met in C'Ville when Matthews was working as a bartender at Miller's. Reynolds, who has played on each Dave Matthews Band album, also has his own group, TR3. These live shows don't have the festival, party atmosphere of the usual Dave Matthews Band concert. This is a fine album to start one's appreciation of Matthews. Not a big DMB fan, but this set is fantastic! And Tim Reynolds is a virtuoso--probably as technically gifted as many respected classical guitarists, but with an equally impeccable ability to reinvent each of Dave's songs so that they have every bit as much groove, humor, emotion, and force (and often more) as they did with his full band backing him up. But I was introduced to Dave's music because I am an avid guitar player. Dave's talent combined with Tim Reynolds' is just something that will just leave you speechless. And Tim Reynolds performance was unsurpassed by anyone I have ever heard. In my opinion, they are using their familiarity with Dave's material to play the underappreciated scholars and poo-poo the rest of the music world. It was clearly Dave Matthews, but it was with an emotion and energy that I didn't pick up from his other recordings.",

The two met in C'Ville when Matthews was working as a bartender at Miller's. Reynolds, who has played on each Dave Matthews Band album, also has his own group, TR3. These live shows don't have the festival, party atmosphere of the usual Dave Matthews Band concert. This is a fine album to start one's appreciation of Matthews. Not a big DMB fan, but this set is fantastic! And Tim Reynolds is a virtuoso--probably as technically gifted as many respected classical guitarists, but with an equally impeccable ability to reinvent each of Dave's songs so that they have every bit as much groove, humor, emotion, and force (and often more) as they did with his full band backing him up. But I was introduced to Dave's music because I am an avid guitar player. Dave's talent combined with Tim Reynolds' is just something that will just leave you speechless. And Tim Reynolds performance was unsurpassed by anyone I have ever heard. In my opinion, they are using their familiarity with Dave's material to play the underappreciated scholars and poo-poo the rest of the music world. It was clearly Dave Matthews, but it was with an emotion and energy that I didn't pick up from his other recordings.",

                                        "description": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nBOSTON — The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has reinstated a bailment complaint brought by the alleged owner of a piano that the late entertainer Liberace had used during performances, ruling that the six-year statute of limitations for certain contract claims applied to the dispute. The foundation claimed in a lawsuit that the piano was simply on loan and that the Piano Mill breached a warehousing agreement and bailment by refusing to return it upon request. “[W[e conclude that a reasonable juror could find based on the record that the breach-of-bailment claim here, like the breach-of-bailment claim in Aimtek, stems from a consensual arrangement between the parties that mutually benefitted them and not from a merely gratuitous bailment, as Norris and Piano Mill contended is the case for the first time at oral argument,” Judge David J. Barron wrote for the panel. What’s disappointing is that there is now yet one more thing for parties to fight over and for judges to have to decide. Still, he said if there is any lasting takeaway, it is that a bailment is more likely than before to be viewed as arising in contract. Boston attorney Michael J. Rossi said a lesson from the case is that imprecision in documenting the terms of a deal is a surefire way to end up in court. When he refused, the foundation sued him and his business in U.S. District Court, alleging breach of a warehousing agreement and bailment. Moreover, a factfinder could also reasonably determine … that Gibson Brands as bailor and Norris and Piano Mill as bailees each benefitted from this consensual arrangement, as … Gibson Brands [allegedly] obtained storage for a valuable asset and avoided the costs of moving the piano while Norris and Piano Mill obtained substantial publicity and marketing opportunities from having possession of the piano.” Accordingly, the panel concluded, the defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on statute-of-limitations grounds.",

If all those requirements seem somewhat outdated, it’s because they probably are. And yet, when the Wolseley Group opens a vast, marble-clad, all-day seafood brasserie serving oysters and dover sole, as well as fish finger sandwiches and knickerbocker glories, many diners will make a note, because here is a venue for all reasons. Manzi’s has about it a whiff of the cruise-ship dining room, which might sound like a slight, but isn’t. At Manzi’s, though, you’re in fact sailing just behind Dean Street and Frith Street, so, the moment you jump ship, its elegant, twinkly spell is broken, because you suddenly find yourself slap-bang in the middle of Soho’s usual bunfight. And a half-pint of prawns for only £14 – was I back in 2015? They go because these places are always open, easy to understand, bookable and tend to have a cast of what seems like thousands on the floor, all cheerily whisking you through a perfectly decent dining experience.",

Marian Anderson broke barriers there in 1928. Billie Holliday brought the blues to Carnegie Hall in 1948. In 1961 Judy Garland gave what many have called the concert of the century at Carnegie Hall that was preserved on a best-selling double LP. In 1992 there was an all-star tribute to composer Stephen Sondheim. The seeming ease of her performance belies the amazing technique that makes it all possible. Ms. Michele is a pyrotechnic artist who makes it all seem simple. They also gave us a warm-hearted “To Make You Feel My Love” which Criss also accompanied on the guitar. The arrangements and orchestrations were first-rate and the players were virtuosic without ever distracting from the main event. We can only hope Lea Michele and Steven Jamail will tour the country with this beautiful evening of songs and stories.
